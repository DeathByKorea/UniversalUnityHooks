# UniversalUnityHooks

## Warning: Unstable release

This branch is currently used for the experimental version of UUH, v3.0. If you are looking for a production ready build of UUH, please visit the [v2](https://github.com/UserR00T/UniversalUnityHooks/tree/v2) branch.

## Todo
Search for the various `// TODO:` comments around the code to view a list of things that are still left to do. The main few ones are:

- [ ] Cleanup `UniversalUnityHooks.Core.Program` - Currently a mess (wanted to get a PoC out before cleaning up the codebase)  
- [ ] Documentation around the code  
- [ ] `<summary>` Tags around the code  
- [ ] Create a proper `README.md`  
- [ ] Create a proper wiki page  
- [ ] More asserts for input files  
- [ ] A `inspect` command - views information about the supplied method or type
